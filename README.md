# Processing Task 4 - Animation

## Learning Objectives
In this task, you will learn about:
* declaring global variables to initialize state values for animation
* modifying the draw() function to animate objects
* variable scope
* resetting state
* bouncing
* clearing old frames


Be sure to check out the `Sketch.java` code in this repository to see the basic arrangement of state variables for your animation.



## Step 1 - Lesson
Acquire the learning objectives by reviewing [this tutorial](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/animation)

## Step 2 - Task
Demonstrate your learning objectives by doing one of the following animation sketches:

### Level 2
Add a rectangle to the bouncing ball program. The ball should bounce off the rectangle as well as the edges of the window.

### Level 3
Remember your drawing program from previous homeworks? Animate it by either bouncing it around the screen or by changing it over time.

### Level 4
Create an animation that shows a full day- start out with a sunrise, show the sun moving across the sky, then sunset, and finally the moon and stars. Change your background accordingly based on the position of the sun.
